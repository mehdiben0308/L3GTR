Retrieve attachements and emails automatically (includes automated response)
All you need to do is provide ur email address (needs to be on gmail) and the password and then tell the program how many emails you want to check for attachements and it will download them automatically and also send an ACK to the sender saying that the files have been downloaded successfully
This code is currently not working thanks to google updating their security standards (check google less secure apps 30 mai 2022)
Might be able to work again if the standards gets canceled
updating this code requires further studies about google authentification 
might be updated in the future
